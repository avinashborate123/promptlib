## ü™ê Prompt

Perform advanced **code refactoring** for the Angular component currently open in the editor, ensuring it aligns with **Micro Frontend (MFE) architecture best practices** while improving clarity, performance, and maintainability.

## Additional Context

This component is part of a **Micro Frontend (MFE) architecture** using Angular and Module Federation. It communicates across multiple MFEs using `CustomEvent`, `sessionStorage`, and shared services (`globalEvent`, `AuthorizationService`). It may run in **embedded or standalone modes** and should maintain **clean isolation, modularization, and cross-MFE readiness**. Refactoring should preserve functionality while improving structure and readiness for testing and scaling.

‚úÖ Focus refactoring on:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Quality and Readability:**
- Improve naming consistency and logical structuring
- Split large functions into smaller reusable methods
- Remove dead code and redundant patterns

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **MFE Architecture Alignment:**
- Ensure isolation and loose coupling for MFE readiness
- Use `CustomEvent` and shared services efficiently
- Validate `sessionStorage` and cross-MFE data handling patterns

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance Optimization:**
- Apply `OnPush` change detection where applicable
- Replace nested subscriptions with higher-order observables
- Optimize async patterns with `async pipe` and clear error handling

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Testability:**
- Ensure public methods are testable
- Simplify complex logic for better unit test coverage
- Remove hidden side-effects

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Error Handling:**
- Add null/undefined safety
- Handle cross-MFE edge cases gracefully
- Validate fallback handling for environment-specific behaviors

‚úÖ Ensure:
- Functionality remains unchanged post-refactor
- Improved maintainability for the developer team
- Readiness for automated testing pipelines
