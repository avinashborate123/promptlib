## Prompt

Perform an advanced **peer code review** for the Angular component currently open in the editor, specifically designed for a **Micro Frontend (MFE) architecture**.

## Additional Context

This component is part of a **Micro Frontend (MFE) architecture** using Angular and Module Federation. It communicates across multiple MFEs using `CustomEvent`, `sessionStorage`, and shared services (`globalEvent`, `AuthorizationService`). The component may run in **embedded or standalone modes** and requires review under different environments (local, dev, APT). Review should consider **cross-MFE data flows, environment-based behaviors, and workbench integration contexts** while ensuring quality, maintainability, and performance.

‚úÖ Provide a **structured review report** with:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Quality:**
- Naming consistency, readability, and clarity
- Use of Angular best practices (`OnPush`, `async pipe`, observable handling)
- Removal of dead code or redundant logic

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Architecture & MFE Readiness:**
- Compliance with module federation and isolation principles
- Correct use of shared services and `CustomEvent` for inter-MFE communication
- Avoid tight coupling between MFEs

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Performance & Optimization:**
- Avoid unnecessary change detection
- Optimize large functions and nested subscriptions
- Lazy loading considerations if applicable

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Testing Readiness:**
- Ensure testability and clear separation of concerns
- Identify missing unit and integration test coverage
- Recommend mocks for testing complex interactions

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Error Handling & Edge Cases:**
- Null/undefined safety and error propagation
- Session and storage handling in MFE context
- Environment-based conditional checks

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Security & Environment Configurations:**
- Secure handling of tokens and sensitive data
- Validate environment configurations (embedded/standalone, dev/prod)
